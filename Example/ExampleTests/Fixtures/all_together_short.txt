#This is a header 1

In the first paragraph we have **bold**, now *some italic*, I like ***both together***.
[this is a link](http://www.google.com) and at the end, `[some code]`

Code test
---------

`We also have some code here, but formatting is not supported inside it: [having links](www.xing.com), **bold**, *italic*, ***and so on*** `

`We can't, however,
have breaks inside code blocks`

List with Stars
----

* A list with [a link](www.chiquitoipsum.com)
* Another element **with** *stuff*
* `with_code_inside()`
* #We can't have a header, the header (#) symbol can be only at the beginning of the line
* www.xing.com is also detected
